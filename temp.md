❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope, nor are they
passed as arguments. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior as it relies on variables from an outer
scope (which might not be initialized or even exist).
* ❌ The function lacks input validation or any mechanism to ensure that `a` and `b` are numbers. If they aren't, the `+`
operator could lead to unexpected results due to type coercion.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {               
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers.";
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Explicit Parameters**: The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making its behavior predictable and
self-contained.
* ✔ **Input Validation**: Added a check to ensure both `a` and `b` are numbers. If not, it returns an error message,
preventing unexpected behavior.
* ✔ **Clarity**: The function's purpose is now clear: to add two numbers passed as arguments.

Final Note:

It's essential for functions to explicitly define their inputs (parameters) and validate them when necessary. Relying on
global variables or assuming input types can lead to bugs and make the code harder to understand and maintain. Always
strive for functions that are self-contained and predictable. 🚀
